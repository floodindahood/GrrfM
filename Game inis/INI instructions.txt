;~~~~~~~~~~~~~ INI INSTRUCTIONS ~~~~~~~~~~~~~;

Each "GameName".ini needs to consist of 2 sections at the very least.

[GameInfo] Where you define the hotkeys and other game specific settings and,
[wepN] Where you define the the weapon specific attributes.

;~~~~~~~~~~ [GameInfo] explanation ~~~~~~~~~~;

[GameInfo]
ahkClass=	The ahk_class of your game window, you can get this with e.g. "AutoIT3 Window Spy" that comes with most fresh installations of AHK
clickMode=	The method of sending clicks, options are either native AHK Click ("click") or a dllcall ("dll").
toggleKey=	The key that toggles whether the rapidfire/no-recoil is active, use AHK's hotkey syntax here (http://www.autohotkey.com/docs/Hotkeys.htm)
fireKey=	The key used for activating the rapidfire/no-recoil, use AHK's hotkey syntax here 
wepKey1=	The key in-game that is used to activate weapon slot 1, use AHK's hotkey syntax here 
wepKey2=	The key in-game that is used to activate weapon slot 2, use AHK's hotkey syntax here 
wepKey3=	The key in-game that is used to activate weapon slot 3, use AHK's hotkey syntax here 

;~~~~~~~~~~~ [wepN] explanation ~~~~~~~~~~~~~;

[wepN] 		Where "N" is the position of the current weapon section. e.g. wep1, wep2... wepN
name=		The name of the weapon displayed in the gui
ammo=		Currently redundant value, you can leave this at 0
rof=		Rate of fire (rof), the rate of fire in milliseconds
rory=		Rate of recoil on Y-axis (rory), the rate of mouse correction per shot fired on Y-axis
rorx=		Rate of recoil on X-axis (rorx), the rate of mouse correction per shot fired on X-axis
rfType=		Rapid fire type (rfType), this can be "off" for single shot, "auto" for full automatic fire or "burst" for burst fire
bC=		Burst Count (bC), if "rfType" is "burst" then this defines how many shots a single burst will fire
